    "This is the first time I've programmed in Python 3 since highschool, as python isn't included in the CE track. I find the block based programming really interesting as it makes debugging and module testing a lot easier. The only issue I had with this assignment is the python syntax, as I keep adding semicolons to the end of each line. Given a few weeks I should be able to write in Python proficiently."
