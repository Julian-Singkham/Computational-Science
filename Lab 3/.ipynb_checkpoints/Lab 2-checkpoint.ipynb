    "The purpose of this lab is to familize ourselves with data cleaning, search term analytics, and spellchecking.  \n",
    "* The first objective was to derive search terms from a csv files and clean the data.  \n",
    "* The second objective was to create a frequency dictionary of the search terms.  \n",
    "* The final objective was to spellcheck the search terms using spellchecker and create a new spellchecked frequency dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The data utilized in this lab is a search term csv file that contains about 1 million search terms used in the direc supply DSSI ecommerce platform"

    "## Conclusion  \n",
    "* The most frequent search tokens for the non-spellchecked data is food items like bacon, milk, chicken, beef. Bacon by far has the most hits with 459, followed by milk at 180 and chicken at 168. This is most likely due to the American breakfast having bacon as one of its components, additionally bacon is the most enjoyed bacon item so this makes sense. Food being the primarily searched items is logical as humans require a large amount of food on a daily basis.  \n",
    "* I hypothesis that numerical only entries are the UIC of the desired product. This would make sense as if I were to look up bacon there would be several different types one could buy, by using the specific UIC of the desired bacon, only one item pops up. Special characters could be search operators such as \"XXX\" being used to specify that the item must contain XXX in the name. \"-XXX\" could be used to specify that the item must not contain XXX.\n",
    "*  The spellchecked data in comparison to the original for the most part is the same. Some items saw a slight increase in frequency such as Juice increasing from 131 to 132 when using the spellchecked data. This isn't a surprise as people for the most part can correctly type the name of an item, I hypothesize that the more complex terms will see a much higher increase in hits due to the nature of the spelling.\n",
    "* Overall I believe the spellchecked data is more accurate than the non-spellchecked version, but the magnitude is relatively small. The accuracy is in part due to most misspellings only containing one error and the spellchecker has relatively high accuracy in its spelling preditcion. As stated before most people should be able to spell words at a high level of accuracy so the only search terms that would benefit from spellchecker are edgecase complex ones. One issue with spellchecking is that the spellchecked version may be incorrect due to spelling properties such as spelling potatoe. The plural form of potato is potatoes so it can be assumed the user forgot an s rather than accidently added e to the word.\n",
    "* The longest runing method is the list_to_freq_dict due to the count() method iterating through each item in the list. This is an O(n^2) operation due to each element in the list iterating through the entire list. If the list is 10x bigger it would take 100 times longer and at 100x it would take 10000 times longer."
